Go Project: Greetings

Welcome to this beginner-friendly Go project! This project consists of a simple program that demonstrates basic concepts in Go, such as modules, packages, functions, error handling, and testing.
Project Structure

    go.mod: This is the Go module file. It defines the module's path and its dependencies.
    hello.go: The main Go file that uses the greetings package to print greeting messages.
    greetings.go: This file contains the greetings package with functions to generate greeting messages.
    greetings_test.go: Contains tests for the greetings package.

Understanding the Code

    hello.go: This is the entry point of the program. It imports the greetings package and uses it to print greeting messages for a set of names.

    greetings.go: Defines two functions, Hello and Hellos. Hello returns a greeting for a single name, and Hellos returns greetings for multiple names. It also demonstrates error handling in Go.

    greetings_test.go: Contains two test functions for the greetings package. These tests check the functionality of the Hello function for both valid and empty input.
